# Welcome to the Co-op Game Repository
## Instructions
1. Check if there is a branch for your assigned Trello card (similar name). If not, create one
2. Compare your branch to the current-build branch
3. Work only within your branch or sub-branches which derive from your branch
4. Assign yourself to the Trello tasks and make sure to communicate with others on that task
5. When making commits and/or pull requests be clear in your comments
6. When a feature is complete/ready to test, create a Pull Request to merge the branch with `review`
7. Pull requests for `current-build` require approvals from other developers
8. Pull requests for `review` require approvals from other developers
9. Ask if you have questions
